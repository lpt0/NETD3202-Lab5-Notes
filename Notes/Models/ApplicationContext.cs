/** ApplicationContext.cs
 * 
 * This context class is what connects the server, ASP.NET Core, with the 
 * database, SQL Server Express (since I don't remember paying for SQL 
 * Server).
 * This uses the Entity Framework Core (since it is .NET Core) to create
 * tables specified by the models used in the application (and specified
 * by including a DbSet for that model). It also takes care of creating the
 * necessary relationships between these models (and tables).
 * The controllers use this context class to communicate with the database,
 * and this can be seen whenever the `_context` variable is used in those
 * files - that variable refers to this context class.
