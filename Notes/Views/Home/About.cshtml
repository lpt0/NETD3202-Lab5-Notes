<h1>About this application</h1>
<p>
    This web-based application allows you to write short (or long) notes that you can view, edit, or delete later, on any internet-connected device, at any time.
</p>
<p>
    You also have the ability to create "groups", which you can use to organize notes into separate categories or collections.
    For example, you could have one group for all of your school notes, another for your shopping lists, and another collection for your personal notes or a to-do list.
</p>
<p>
    You can get started by clicking "Create a Note" on the left, or by clicking <a asp-controller="Notes" asp-action="Create"> here.</a>
